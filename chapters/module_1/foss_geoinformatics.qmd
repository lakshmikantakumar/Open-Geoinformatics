# Introduction to FOSS Geoinformatics

## What is FOSS Geoinformatics?

*Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) Geoinformatics* includes applications and libraries whose **source code is openly available** for use, 
study, modification, and redistribution under open licenses. FOSS spans the entire spatial workflow:

- **GIS** for mapping and spatial analysis.  
- **Remote sensing & digital image processing** for Earth observation data.  
- **GNSS** for precise positioning and navigation.  
- **Web GIS & spatial databases** for publishing and interoperability.  
- **Visualization** for communication and decision support.

## Why FOSS Geoinformatics Matters

- **Affordable access**: lowers entry barriers for education, community use, NGOs, and startups.  
- **Community-driven development**: global collaboration supports continuous improvement.  
- **Adaptability**: tools can be customized for local workflows and languages.  
- **Transparency**: open code enables verification of methods and security.  
- **Capacity building**: encourages learning and experimentation.  
- **Interoperability**: open standards (e.g., OGC/ISO) enable integration across platforms.  
- **Platform flexibility**: commonly available for Linux, Windows, and macOS.  
- **Integration across domains**: unifies GIS, RS, GNSS, databases, and the web.

## Importance of Open-Source Data & Software in NGP 2022

The **National Geospatial Policy (NGP) 2022** encourages **open standards, open data, and open-source platforms**. This direction promotes accessibility, interoperability, and reuse across agencies, academia, industry, and communities.

By promoting FOSS Geoinformatics:

- **Communities** can use spatial data for local planning and risk reduction.  
- **Educational institutions** can train students without licensing restrictions.  
- **Startups and NGOs** can develop cost-effective geospatial services.  

This approach supports a **self-reliant, transparent, and future-ready geospatial ecosystem**, reduces vendor dependence, and strengthens collaboration.

## Conclusion

FOSS Geoinformatics is reshaping how spatial data are **collected, processed, analyzed, and communicated**. Open tools such as **QGIS, GRASS GIS, OTB, 
SNAP, PostGIS, GeoServer**, and open GNSS stacks like **RTKLIB, GPSTk, goGPS, and GNSS-SDR** enable integrated and interoperable workflows. Communities worldwide can now 
contribute to and benefit from shared spatial knowledge, empowering students, researchers, governments, and industries to solve real-world problems.

However, true collaboration requires more than just open tools and data. Different systems must follow common rules to share and understand information effectively. 
This is where **open standards** become essential, providing the universal language that makes geospatial technologies interoperable. 
The next chapter introduces these open standards.

# Introduction to GIS

## What is GIS?
A Geographic Information System (GIS) is a computer-based framework that allows us to work with information that has a spatial or geographic component. 
In simple terms, GIS links **“what” data is about** with **“where” it is located on Earth**. This combination makes it possible to explore patterns, 
detect relationships, and make informed decisions.  

### Definition of GIS

A Geographic Information System (GIS) is a framework that supports the collection, management, analysis, and visualization of spatial and non-spatial data. It integrates hardware, 
software, data, people, and methods to efficiently handle geographically referenced information \[@albrecht2007; @wilson2008]. By linking data to locations on Earth, GIS allows users to capture, store, manipulate, and display information that supports decision-making in fields such as urban planning, environmental management, agriculture, transportation, and disaster response \[@yang2011].

## Components of GIS

A GIS is composed of several interconnected components that work together:

* **Hardware**: Computing systems with adequate processing power, memory, storage, and input/output devices.
* **Software**: GIS applications and operating systems that provide tools for data analysis, management, and visualization.
* **Data**: Spatial data (geographic features), attribute data (descriptive information), and metadata (documentation about quality and origin).
* **People**: Users and professionals who design, implement, and apply GIS solutions.
* **Methods**: Procedures and workflows that ensure data acquisition, analysis, validation, and presentation follow consistent standards \[@brimicombe2010].

These components interact continuously. Without reliable data, advanced software, or skilled users, the system would not function effectively.

## Why GIS is Important?

GIS has become essential because it improves efficiency and accuracy in working with geographic information. Its benefits include:

* Handling large datasets more effectively than manual methods.
* Supporting complex spatial queries and analyses.
* Allowing integration of diverse datasets from multiple sources.
* Reducing redundancy by linking spatial and attribute information.
* Providing powerful visualization and communication tools \[@yang2011].

## Functions of GIS

The main functions of GIS are closely connected, with each step supporting the next:

* **Data capture**: Collecting information through digitization, scanning, remote sensing, and GNSS.
* **Data storage and management**: Organizing vector and raster models, with indexing and metadata to support retrieval and integration.

  * **Vector**: Represents discrete objects such as roads and parcels.
  * **Raster**: Represents continuous surfaces such as elevation and temperature.
* **Querying**: Retrieving data by spatial location or attribute values.
* **Analysis**: Using tools such as buffering, overlay, interpolation, and terrain modeling.
* **Visualization**: Producing maps, graphs, dashboards, and 3D visualizations.
* **Output and communication**: Delivering results in reports, web maps, or decision-support systems \[@campbell2011].

## GIS Workflow

A typical GIS workflow progresses through several connected stages:

### Data Acquisition

This stage involves collecting raw spatial and attribute data. Sources include ground surveys, GPS, aerial photography, satellite imagery, and existing databases. Reliable 
data acquisition ensures that subsequent steps are based on accurate representations of real-world phenomena.

### Data Validation

Validation checks the accuracy and consistency of the acquired data. Errors such as missing values, spatial mismatches, and attribute inconsistencies are identified and corrected. 
This step improves the quality of data and builds confidence for further analysis.

### Data Management

Validated data is organized into databases or spatial infrastructures. Processes such as georeferencing, projection transformations, and indexing make the data usable. 
Effective management ensures the data can be retrieved and updated when needed.

### Data Analysis and Modeling

At this stage, GIS tools are applied to derive insights. Analyses may include overlays, spatial statistics, change detection, and predictive modeling. This step transforms 
raw data into meaningful information that supports planning and decision-making.

### Visualization and Output

Finally, results are communicated through clear visual formats. These include thematic maps, 3D views, dashboards, or printed reports. Effective visualization ensures that 
technical results are accessible to both specialists and non-specialists.

### Open-source vs Proprietary GIS

Open-source platforms such as QGIS, GRASS, and PostGIS are cost-effective, adaptable, and community-supported. They provide transparency of source code and strong plugin ecosystems,
 although they may lack formal support and advanced commercial features. 
 
 Proprietary platforms such as ArcGIS, ENVI, and ERDAS IMAGINE are robust, well-documented, and supported by dedicated companies. However, they are expensive and less flexible for customization.

## Future Trends in GIS

The future of GIS is shaped by new technologies:

* **Web GIS** and **cloud computing** are making GIS more scalable and accessible.
* **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning** support predictive analytics and pattern recognition.
* **Mobile GIS** allows real-time data collection in the field.
* **Big data integration** strengthens spatial analysis of complex and large-scale phenomena \[@wilson2008; @yang2011].

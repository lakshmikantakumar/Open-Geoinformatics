# Introduction to WebGIS

## What is WebGIS?

WebGIS is a Geographic Information System that operates through the internet. Unlike traditional desktop GIS, WebGIS enables users to access, visualize, analyze, and share geospatial data directly 
from a web browser without requiring specialized software. The primary goal of WebGIS is the democratization of geospatial information by making it widely accessible.

Key characteristics of WebGIS include the following: 
 
- Accessible via the internet using standard web browsers  
- Requires minimal installation at the client side  
- Supports real-time data sharing and collaboration  
- Often built on open standards and free and open-source software (FOSS) [@mitchell2005webmapping]

## Evolution of GIS to WebGIS

The development of GIS began in the 1960s with desktop-based systems. With the rise of the internet in the 1990s, GIS started moving online. The availability of faster networks, open standards,
 and lightweight web programming languages enabled the shift from standalone GIS to WebGIS.

Some important milestones in this evolution include:
  
- 1960sâ€“1980s: Desktop GIS focused on specialized users [@jones2008webgis]  
- 1990s: Internet-enabled GIS applications emerged  
- 2000s: Open Source GIS tools like MapServer and PostGIS supported online mapping [@mitchell2005webmapping]  
- 2010s onwards: Cloud GIS and real-time WebGIS applications became mainstream  

## WebGIS vs. Traditional Desktop GIS

Table: **Comparison of Desktop GIS and WebGIS**

| Feature              | Desktop GIS              | WebGIS                        |
|----------------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Accessibility        | Installed on local machines | Accessible via web browsers   |
| User Base            | Specialists and experts   | General public and specialists |
| Data Sharing         | Manual file exchange      | Real-time data sharing online  |
| Cost                 | Often commercial licenses | Many FOSS options available    |

## Components of a WebGIS

A WebGIS is composed of three main elements, each playing a critical role in delivering geospatial services over the web: 
 
- **Client-side (Frontend):** The user interface, often built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript libraries such as Leaflet and OpenLayers  
- **Server-side (Backend):** Manages requests, processes data, and delivers maps using tools like GeoServer and MapServer  
- **Database:** Stores and manages spatial data, with common FOSS options including PostGIS and Spatialite [@mitchell2005webmapping]

## Importance of WebGIS

The importance of WebGIS lies in its ability to extend geospatial capabilities beyond specialists. It plays a crucial role in governance, research, and community participation.

Key benefits of WebGIS include:  

- Enhances accessibility of geospatial data [@jones2008webgis]  
- Facilitates collaboration across disciplines and locations  
- Supports decision-making in urban planning, disaster management, and environmental monitoring  
- Promotes open data initiatives and citizen science  


## Examples of WebGIS Applications

Many well-known platforms demonstrate the capabilities of WebGIS. Some examples are:  

- **[Google Maps](https://maps.google.com):** A popular navigation and mapping platform for general use  
- **[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org):** A collaborative, open-source mapping initiative  
- **Geoportals (e.g., [USGS EarthExplorer](https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/), [European Copernicus Open Access Hub](https://scihub.copernicus.eu/)):**  
- **[Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT)](https://www.hotosm.org/):** Community-driven mapping for disaster response.  
- **[World Bank GeoNode](https://geonode.worldbank.org/):** Open platform for global development and spatial data sharing. Platforms from governments and universities offering public geospatial data [@jones2008webgis]  

## Conclusion
This introductory chapter has outlined the meaning, evolution, and importance of WebGIS. It explained how WebGIS differs from traditional GIS and described the components that make it operational.
 The importance of WebGIS lies in enhancing accessibility, supporting collaborative research, and encouraging participatory mapping through FOSS and open data initiatives.  

As the internet continues to influence data accessibility, WebGIS is becoming central to modern geospatial practices. The next chapter will introduce the **fundamental web principles** 
that underpin WebGIS. Understanding how the web functions, including client-server communication and the role of protocols, provides the foundation for grasping how geospatial data is shared and visualized online.

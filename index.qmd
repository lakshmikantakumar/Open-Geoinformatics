# Preface {.unnumbered}

The discipline of Geoinformatics stands at the intersection of geography, information technology, and earth sciences, providing powerful tools for spatial data acquisition, 
analysis, and decision-making. Its applications span diverse fields such as environmental management, urban and regional planning, disaster risk reduction, natural resource 
monitoring, and governance, reflecting its growing significance in both academia and industry [@goodchild2007; @li2020].

This lecture note, titled Open Geoinformatics is being prepared as a comprehensive introductory resource for students, 
researchers, and practitioners seeking to build a foundation in geospatial science and technology. A special emphasis is placed on Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) tools 
and datasets, ensuring that the knowledge imparted is not only theoretically rigorous but also practically accessible without licensing restrictions.

The content presents essential concepts of Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Remote Sensing (RS), Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), Spatial Databases, 
and WebGIS, with a balanced focus on theory and practice. The structure is designed to support stepwise learning—beginning with fundamentals and gradually progressing 
toward advanced applications and integration of geospatial technologies.

In particular, this work acknowledges the invaluable role of FOSS geospatial platforms and libraries—including QGIS [@qgis2024], SAGA GIS [@saga2008], PostGIS [@postgis2023], 
GeoServer [@geoserver2024], and GDAL/OGR [@gdal2023]. These tools, along with contributions from numerous other open-source projects, not only provide world-class functionality 
but also embody the spirit of collaborative knowledge-building and open science.

The compilation draws upon established literature and best practices in the field, while also incorporating open-source software environments, community-driven innovations, 
and contemporary applications to make the learning process relevant in today’s context. It is hoped that this work will not only serve as a guide for academic study but also 
inspire further exploration, research, and innovation in the open geospatial domain.

I gratefully acknowledge the contributions of scholars, researchers, and the global FOSS community whose works form the intellectual and technical foundation of this discipline. 
Any inadvertent omission of citation is unintentional, and suggestions for improvement and inclusion of additional references are warmly welcomed.
